    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exploration, I found out that Data plan and Monthly charges features helped more in predicting if the customers will stay with the company or leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Via a heatmap between churn and data plan, I found out that more of the customers had no data plan and were lost by the company. About 80(8.5%) of the customers had data plans but were still lost by the company. But a higher percentage of 403(16.7%) who did not have data plan left the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when more customers have no data plan, it leads to them not using data from the company and will eventually make them not to renew their contracts. But, I found out that what's making them to have no data plan is high monthly charges. So the data plan isn't friendly, and I strongly suggested this should be looked into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friendly data plans are going to make the customers buy and use more data, and it will eventually make the renew their data plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is also affected by Customer service calls. I noticed that the customers who made more than two customer service calls didn't recently renew their contracts. It could be that their concerns wasn't addresses in those calls or maybe it took more time for their issues to be resolved. To conclude this, I will need more data like how much time each customer spent on those calls, and if their issue was resolved after making up two two calls or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did suggest that immediate improvementshould be made in the quality of customer service that are being provided to the customers and the company should make sure that their issues are resolved within 1 to 2 calls."

    "For the presentation, I start by introducing the distribution of each of these variables, with Churn and the other two categorical variables leading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I then introduced how churn correlates with the other two categorical variables which are contract renewal and data plan. Then, I introduced how churn relates with other variables like monthly charge and data usage, and how monthly charge relates with data plan and contract renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I went further to show how all these features affects the target variable which is customer churn."
